## General Information
- What: this project (Kaggle competition) utilizes the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset which is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
- Goal: correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
- Purpose: Test different machine learning models in a computer vision problem.
